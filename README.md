# SkinCancerDetectionDesktopApp
###### using Pytorch CNN and Python PyQT5 and SQLite database

When the application is opened, we encounter the homepage. Through this homepage, we are directed either to the page where we can directly perform the prediction process or to the doctor user page.

In the prediction page, users can upload skin photos that raise suspicion of skin cancer directly to the system and obtain a prediction result.

If the user is a doctor, they can create an account first if they haven't already done so, and then log in through this interface.

With this page, users can upload their results to the database to improve the accuracy of the model in the future and view the saved data in the database.
